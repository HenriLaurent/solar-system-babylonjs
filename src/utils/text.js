    description: `<p>Our solar system, a cosmic wonder 4.6 billion years old, is a fascinating ensemble of celestial bodies orbiting our central star, the Sun.</p>

    <h2>The Sun</h2>

    <p>At the heart of our system lies the Sun, a yellow dwarf star that contains 99.86% of the solar system's total mass. Its powerful gravity keeps all other objects in orbit, and its light sustains life on Earth.</p>

    <h2>The Planets</h2>

    <p>Eight major planets orbit the Sun, each unique in its composition and characteristics:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mercury</strong>: The smallest and closest to the Sun, with a crater-riddled surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Venus</strong>: Often called Earth's twin, but with a toxic atmosphere and extreme temperatures.</li>
        <li><strong>Earth</strong>: Our home, the only known planet to harbor life.</li>
        <li><strong>Mars</strong>: The "Red Planet," with polar ice caps and the possibility of liquid water in the past.</li>
        <li><strong>Jupiter</strong>: The largest planet, a gas giant with its iconic Great Red Spot.</li>
        <li><strong>Saturn</strong>: Recognizable by its magnificent rings, composed mainly of ice and rocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Uranus</strong>: A blue-green ice giant with a unique rotational axis.</li>
        <li><strong>Neptune</strong>: The most distant planet, known for its violent winds and deep blue color.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Other Celestial Bodies</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Asteroid Belt</strong>: Located between Mars and Jupiter, it contains millions of small rocky objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Kuiper Belt</strong>: Beyond Neptune, this region is home to icy objects, including Pluto.</li>
        <li><strong>Comets</strong>: Icy bodies that develop bright tails as they approach the Sun.</li>
        <li><strong>Moons</strong>: Over 200 moons orbit the planets, each with its own unique characteristics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exploration</h2>

    <p>Humanity continues to explore our solar system through robotic missions and, potentially in the future, manned missions to Mars and beyond. Each new discovery helps us better understand our place in the universe and the origins of our own planet.</p>

    <p>The solar system remains an infinite playground for science, inspiring wonder and curiosity in people of all ages.</p>`

    <p>Mars is known for its reddish appearance caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide. Mars features the largest known volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and a canyon system, Valles Marineris, that dwarfs Earth's Grand Canyon.

    <p>Jupiter is known for its Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been raging for hundreds of years. It has a strong magnetic field and numerous moons, including the four largest, known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

    <p>Uranus is an ice giant, composed mainly of icy materials such as water, ammonia, and methane. Its unique feature is its tilted axis of rotation, causing extreme seasonal variations.

    <p>The Moon is the only celestial body beyond Earth that humans have visited. Its surface is covered with impact craters, and it has no substantial atmosphere.

    <p>Io's surface is covered with sulfur and sulfur dioxide frost, giving it a distinctive yellow-orange-red coloration. Its volcanic activity is caused by tidal heating from friction generated within Io's interior as it is pulled between Jupiter and the other Galilean moons.

    <p>Europa's surface is composed of water ice and is one of the smoothest in the Solar System. Scientists believe a salt water ocean exists beneath its frozen surface, kept liquid by tidal heating.

    <p>Ganymede is the only moon known to have its own magnetic field, likely created by convection within its liquid iron core.

    <p>Callisto has the oldest and most heavily cratered surface of any body in the Solar System. Unlike other Galilean moons, Callisto appears to have little internal structure or geological activity. Its surface is composed of rock and ice, and it may have a subsurface ocean at high depths.

    <p>Titania is composed of roughly equal amounts of ice and rock, and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle. Its surface shows evidence of past geological activity, with extensive systems of canyons and scarps. Titania's surface is relatively dark and slightly red in color.
